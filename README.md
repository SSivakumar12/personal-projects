# personal-projects

These are numerous data sciencey projects that I have done independently. Please feel free to drop any comments on what you think as well as taking any of this source code and extending it to your own project.

Make sure when you carry out your own project it isn't a straight up copy of another project. Make it unique and personal to you! This is the only way to learn.

As of 2022 the project that I have are in python:

- using Linear Regression models to predict stock prices in order to decide when to invest in certain stock based on historical data 
- building a security camera using a webcam and trying to create a notification when it is trigger
